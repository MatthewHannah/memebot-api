# Memebot API
The API for interacting with the MemeBot Database

## Getting Started

1. Install node via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installation-and-update) or some other method. The node version for this project can be found in `.nvmrc`.

2. Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

3. Install dependencies with `yarn install`

4. Install [MongoDB Community Edition](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/#mongodb-community-edition-installation-tutorials) and run a local server on `localhost:4000` (should be the default)

5. Seed the database with `yarn seed`

6. Start the graphql server with `yarn develop`

## Code Formatting

If you would like to contribute to the project, I recommend setting up linters and style checkers according to the [code formatting wiki entry](https://github.com/arjunchib/memebot-api/wiki/Code-Formatting)
